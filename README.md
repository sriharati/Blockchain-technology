The security of secure messaging systems has improved substantially over recent years; Systems like WhatsApp and Signal is designed to be usable by anyone, not just experts, and to provide much of the same functionality as existing insecure messaging applications. Asynchronous message communication with encryption and hashing security has been introduced.



This project involves multiple-way connections using blockchain technology. And this Blockchain system has 3 block transactions of messages in a linked list. Every transaction has a unique hash value that cannot be tampered with. So, if someone tries to hack the system, then the chain will automatically terminate the blocks as the previous hash value contained in every other consecutive block is distributed ledge.
